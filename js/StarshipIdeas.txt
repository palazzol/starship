Ideas for starship:

config file:

ref coord system

object trajectories

object definition:
	initial condition
	trajectory
	
internals:

ship coordinate system

ray-intersection engine
	(look at cuda)
	
1) handle acceleration as piecewise constant
2) Try to use mass/energy relation propulsion
3) handle acceleration as piecewise constant?
4) create navigation algorithm for "target intercept"

2D and 3D rendering
color shifting
brightness shifting

look at mit engine OpenRelativity

backstory

test particle in curved spacetime

multiplayer considerations?
