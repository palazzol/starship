Ideas for starship:

config file:

ref coord system

object trajectories

object definition:
	initial condition
	trajectory
	
internals:

ship coordinate system

ray-intersection engine
	(look at cuda)
	
1) handle acceleration as piecewise constant
2) Try to use mass/energy relation propulsion
3) handle acceleration as piecewise constant? *
3.5) allow for different and quantified amounts of thrust
4) create navigation algorithm for "target intercept"

2D and 3D rendering
color shifting
brightness shifting

look at mit engine OpenRelativity

backstory

test particle in curved spacetime

multiplayer considerations?

Notes from 2/12/2014 audio file

console region & text
- vector text?
- brightening, fading?

add touch/key targetting
target icon
display velocity info
display location info
maybe use sprites in text area

load/save prerecorded file, with pause/continue, text descriptions

circles 
- equidistant from you, or another target
- could be grid

- display manager?

coordinate systems
- object (global)
- screen (pixels)
- ships (local) coordinate system
- cleanup/document

deployment
x grunt installed
- minification / staging

debug display
- graphics vs calculation framerate

options for framerate
- fixed vs variable?

toggle observed vs measured, both at once?

projectiles
- mass drivers
- light beams - lasers or photon packets

targetting computer
- dumb shots
- homing shots
- smart aiming

navigation computer
- point to point navigation

automated enemy ships
- targetting and/or navigation

add jsdoc
try webstorm again?

get fullscreen working on android
