Possible viewpoints:

---

first-person:
    everything in object coordinates
    
third-person:
    everthing in standard coordinates

Hybrid 2D viewpoints:

A) "fixed ship stays in middle"
    object coordinates, except rotated and offset such that:
    object position is stationary
    object rotation is stationary
    (exactly like first person)
    
B) "rotating ship stays in middle"
    object coordinates, except rotated and offset such that:
        obj position is stationary
        obj orientation is aligned to standard coordinates (?)
    Can be accomplished by rotating A to ?
    
C) "rotating ship moves on screen"
    object coordinates, except rotated and offset such that:
        obj position is offset to standard coordinates
        obj orientation is aligned to standard coordinates (?)
    Can be accomplished by offsetting B to standard coordinate position
    
Current Architecture:

B)

Units:

Time is in seconds
Space is in light-seconds/100  (100 = one light-second)
Therefore C = 100.0, making v in percentage of the speed of light
